## The problem
The current steps that students take to look at courses involves downloading and scrolling through a large PDF file. This file gets frequently updated, which requires the students to re-download to see the changes. This has proven to be inconvenient and aggravating the already stressful registering process.

## The solution
A centralized web application where students have multiple searching options to choose from.

### Search pages
All of the search pages except for the General Education Requirements one provide the user with fields to input their search values, some of which require the user to input a non-empty string before proceeding, some donâ€™t. All fields have placeholder texts that suggest reasonable values to the user.

#### General Education Requirements page

For the General Education Requirements page, the web presents the user with a dropdown menu instead of text fields due to their complex/nonconforming names and the limited number of options.
